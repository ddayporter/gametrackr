# Feedback

## Project Workflow

**Meets expectations**

Nice readme and planning folder.  Quite thorough.  Excellent first impression.

## Technical Requirements

**Exceeds Expectations**

Nice work.  You succeeded in battling the many/many, including the add/remove character functionality.  I see the devise views, so I'm assuming you need to customize something.  I recommend that you do this in more than one commit; generate the views, commit, make changes.  Also, feel free to delete whatever views you didn't change.

## Creativity / Interface

**Exceeds expectations**

The add/remove character functionality is nice.  The links to other game info (layout, rules, etc) were a nice touch.  With an event like "donuts", I have to play this game.

## Code Quality

**Meets Expectations**

Good naming and organization.  I made some in-line comments with more details / suggestions for improvement, and happy to pair next week on them if you have any questions.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets expectations**

I hope you enjoyed working on this project.  I enjoyed reviewing it.  I think you have something here.  I recommend you continue working on it.
