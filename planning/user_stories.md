## User Stories

### Bronze Level
A user should be able to...
* set up an account so they can track games they've played
* create "boards" of game types, so they can track stats on particular types of
games
* add an image of the game by URL to a board
* track players, winners and game notes so they can refer back to past games
* sort by date
* optionally add photo by URL to each game play instance

### Silver Level
Additionally, a user should be able to...
* create player profiles so they can track stats on each player
* upload photos rather than use a URL to associate a photo with a player

### Gold Level
* Instead of creating a generic game board, a user should be able to select a
game from a list of pre-loaded games and track specific stats related to that
game
  * example: Smashup, a user would be able to track which expansions were in
  effect in a given game, and which factions were played by which player
